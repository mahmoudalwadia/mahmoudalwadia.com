What if I ask you to join me in building an e-commerce platform offering car subscriptions as a service while its mission is making mobility fun and sustainable. Would you join? I know it sounds like nonsense. How can e-commerce work with cars and subscriptions as an e-commerce service while keeping all this carbon-neutral? Or may you not see the problem here or the big challenge at all?

Well, two and half years ago, I said yes. I joined [FINN](https://www.finn.auto/) as one of the first engineers while the company was in the pre-seed fund round. We headed full of energy to contribute to a better future by solving some of the car ownership issues while keeping it a green process. In this post, I will talk about car ownership, the car subscription, the sustainability, the struggles, the engineering power, and the FINN spirit and values.

#### Buying? Leasing? Renting? Nah. I want a subscription.

Everything has pros and cons. Our customers don't prefer leasing due to the extra costs and inflexible terms. At the same time, renting is still for short-term purposes. Lastly, buying is an overwhelming decision because of the high price and the depreciation; here we are left with our beloved one, the one we are counting on, FINN's subscription.

#### FINN's subscription-like nothing else

Our beliefs about the car subscription revolve around it being:

> [Carefree](https://www.finn.auto/en-US/how-it-works#:~:text=no%20strings%20attached.-,Carefree) (Everything included but fuel): Fully comprehensive insurance, registration and taxes, maintenance, general inspection, mobility guarantee, and 24/7 emergency hotline. All these are included in the fixed monthly price, with no deposit or hidden costs.

> [Flexible](https://www.finn.auto/en-US/how-it-works#:~:text=Carefree-,Flexible,-Sustainable) (Short terms): Not looking to get tied down by a long-term contract? Start your subscription with FINN for a period as low as six months. We offer you fair rates and give you a choice between flexible mileage packages - so that you can adapt your package perfectly to your needs. You decide how much and how long you want to drive your car.

> [Simple](https://www.finn.auto/en-US/how-it-works#:~:text=Sustainable-,Simple) (Delivery straight to your doorstep): With FINN, you don't even have to leave your couch for a new car. Please choose your preferred delivery date on our website and receive your new vehicle in the comfort of your own home. We deliver from Monday to Friday to your desired address, as long as it is in our delivery area.

All you need to do to get a brand new car is to open the FINN website and discover the available models, then go through a less than 3-minutes checkout process (No Joke), and within the determined delivery date, you will receive it at your doorstep, free of charge. With 24/7 support.

#### Sustainability matters

In the beginning, let me be direct with you, we at FINN can't promise to solve the climate change issue, but we can promise to try our best and make little progress with each subscription. Like many people around the world, we strive for a greener future. We are already aware that our physical product is the car, [One of the most significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#transportation). We believe mobility should come without a guilty conscience, so we are working hard to reduce the damage by increasing the number of electric cars in our fleet and applying CO2 offset for all the vehicles we offer.

> [Mobility without a guilty conscience](https://www.finn.auto/en-US/sustainability#:~:text=Mobility%20without%20a%20guilty%20conscience): Carefree and sustainable - we are convinced that driving can be both and should be both. For this reason, we offset the entire CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of our fleet based on the average vehicle consumption. For every kilogram of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted, we pay a fixed amount to ClimatePartner, with the proceeds benefiting select climate protection projects. In addition, we offer our customers an introduction to electric mobility with our range of fully electric vehicles. That means you can always be carbon-neutral on the road - regardless of your everyday life and mobility needs.

> [This is how we offset CO<sub>2</sub> emissions](https://www.finn.auto/en-US/sustainability#:~:text=This%20is%20how%20we%20offset%20CO2%20emissions): When fuel is burned, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are generated - always the same amount per liter of fuel. ClimatePartner calculates the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the FINN fleet based on the average consumption of all vehicles in active use. Since the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of gasoline and diesel engines are different, the FINN fleet consumption is calculated according to the type of fuel. The number of active plug-in hybrids (PHEV) at FINN is also considered in the calculation. In addition, when calculating consumption, emissions are also indirectly taken into account, such as those caused by the production and distribution of fuels. This also applies to all fully electric cars in our fleet.

May you not be convinced enough with this? While I understand you, I still believe this's crucial; Trying to reduce the damage is better than not doing anything. If we want the world to change, we need to think that change is possible. We at FINN believe that change is possible, and it comes with small steps, so we took these steps while hoping for a better future for the next generations and us.

#### Engineers of efficiency

The engineering organization's purpose inside any company is to make sure the business win over the competition. At FINN, we integrated tech in each part of the company to boost our business beyond the level. We build our platform from scratch. Our marketing is highly automated. We fully automated our financing and reporting processes. We collect every single piece of data, then process and prepare it for the use of optimizing our decisions company-wide, etc. Here I will talk about two parts I see as fascinating and mind-blowing.

##### The e-commerce platform

We built our car subscription platform ourselves from scratch; we put a lot of effort into that; we customized the way that makes the customers get a car the same as they get their new outfit online, even more straightforward. Getting a new car is a long, painful process. It includes collecting customer data, validating customer credit score, checking all other documents, registering the vehicle, etc. In the meantime, FINN's customers should not worry about all of this; we made it super smooth with our platform. We built a website and mobile app where customers can go and book a car in less than 8 minutes, including the time of discovering the desired car.

What you see in this chart is how we built our platform. We store our customer data in CRM to manage deals in the long run while making it easy for business people (mainly customer sales and customer support) to access and update it if there is a need for it. Still, we store deals and fleeting data in our database. We connect our DB/CRM with the rest of the system by serverless services we built internally. We created our solution for building dynamic content pages by introducing the page builder service. This service translates the data in our headless CMS to well-designed web pages in runtime to power our content people and make them not rely on developers when creating a page.

Our platform is built in a way that combines the tech complexity and the business insights. We customized our customer journey based on the data we collected over time. We are connecting this journey with our advertising services to optimize our future digital marketing spending by targeting the right people with high potential to be FINN customers.

What you see here is what we call a <b>car subscription generation machine</b>, and literally, it is. All you need to do is control two factors as you wish: paid ads budget and the amount of the available cars. And here you go.

##### We craft automation like no one else.

Automation is a key, people said. I would say it's the door for faster growth/better scale, and how you use it is the key. Now the optimal setup will be that the tech people are responsible for building the automation in the company. At FINN, it's not the case since everyone at the company can build automation. Powering people with the right tools is a brilliant move to do. We at FINN partnered with big names in the codeless field to provide our people with it.

You would think now why we are wasting the time of business people doing tech stuff while they can be more valuable with what they can do. It's a valid question but thinks about the amount of manual work they do daily. For this amount of automation, you need to be 10x the tech engineering team size of what we currently have. So why rely on the workforce only when we can be more innovative and invest a little in our onboarding process for the new joiners company-wide. FINN's onboarding process is a well-set up one from introducing the tools we use in the company. So almost every new joiner will be introduced to our main codeless automation tools ([Make](https://www.make.com/), [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/), [NocoDB](https://nocodb.com/)) while being mentored by a technical person. We came up with a new position in the company for automation purposes; we call them [Business Automation Manager (BAM)](https://jobs.lever.co/finn.auto/8078148e-2c8f-4878-8f08-c3bd293a04f1).

Introducing BAM to our teams helped our business people craft their automation skills. All the automation they build is codeless and done by the codeless tools I mentioned before. Business people can do this kind of automation in less than a couple of hours, and it will help them save a tremendous amount of time in the long run. Powering everyone to build automation and having BAM mentoring and helping them is an ingenious setup. That gives the engineers the time to focus on the bigger picture and put all the efforts into scaling up the system to deliver the best technical solution in the industry.

<b>Codeless backbone tools</b>:

> Using [Airtable](https://www.airtable.com/) allowed everyone to use DB and not rely on an expert. In the early days of any project, there were a lot of frequent schema changes. Using Airtable's UI, it was effortless to do so within seconds. Anyone could create tables, add lookup fields, and compute fields from other tables.

> [Make(Integromat)](https://www.make.com/) allows us to connect various tools and automate stuff, like fleeting cars, managing subscription data, etc. It comes out of the box with webhooks, queues, iterators, branching, etc. Debugging comes with an execution history where you can check each module for input and output.

This approach has come with its bottleneck. Now running a start-up in the early years means pursuing fast growth. After a while, when things get bigger, it turns into scalability is the name of the game. That means we need to keep the fast growth while ensuring the system will be stable on a bigger scale. Now, coming back to the codeless approach, we know it's all about a trade-off for solving the immediate pressing problems while focusing on the business from the other side. That indeed introduced a technical debt in the long run. Fortunately, our engineering team has enough experience to react to the technical debt by not worrying about it more than embracing it. As I showed in the last chart, the engineers have enough time to focus on the system scalability with such a setup.

#### Struggles we have been embraced.

Building such a fast-growing car ownership platform comes with many challenges in all aspects from technical, fleet stock, financing, and operations. I talked about some of the challenges on the technical side. I want to babble about other business-related challenges.

By building the <b>car subscription generation machine</b>, which we have talked about before, the output was generating [+200 new subscriptions a day](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maxjosefmeier_carsubscriptions-growth-activity-6859081018960351232-aPRw) which is a significant number that caused severe concerns in some areas.

##### Cars stock

[Cars OEMs slowed down their production lines due to COVID](https://www.coatingsworld.com/issues/2022-03-01/view_features/the-automotive-oem-market-faces-challenges-opportunities-in-2022/). That affected our cars' availability and limited us with a shortlist of brands for some time. Luckily, we have a very professional awesome people at our <b>Fleet Purchasing</b> department, who have an extensive network in the automotive industry worldwide, partnered with many big brands, and closed deals with thousands of cars.

With the Fleet Purchasing department's extraordinary efforts, this was how our product listing page looked at some point in time.

##### Cars financing

Cars are costly, and we can't finance all of them ourselves. Our financing team worked hard to find a scalable and sustainable solution. We introduced the D2C financing method in collaboration with big banks (Bank11, Santander) and automated all the processes from validating customers' required information and documents and submitting it to the banks. Also, [our amazing financing team at FINN has secured up to EUR 500m in debt capital to expand our fleet](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6876596952922890240-BDY2).

#### Final reflection

Even after working for more than two years at FINN, I am still amazed daily by the incredible amount of energy people have at the company. Now, if you asked me to describe FINN's spirit in one word, I would say the same answer as any person at FINN will do. Energetic! This kind of spirit is [the company's core values](https://www.finn.auto/careers#:~:text=by%20our%20customers.-,Our%20Values,-Customer%20first). Which is what we are looking for in our candidates.

You may also wonder about something else. You got the point about making mobility sustainable, but what about making it fun? Also, it wasn't clear to me. What we provide is just a car. That's what I thought initially. How does this make it more fun than other car dealers?

I figured out that we don't sell cars, we sell subscriptions, and FINN's subscription means an outstanding user experience. We are standing out there doing everything to the customers from the moment they think about getting a car until they receive the keys at their doorstep and while driving it. That is what carefree means; our customers should not worry about anything related to the car; they only need to drive it as they wish. Cars are part of the mobility world, and mobility means freedom. FINN subscription is about freeing the customers' minds while traveling to their destinations driving FINN's car. That's what is fun.

I joined FINN two and a half years ago. Back then, FINN was a small team with two pages website built with [Webflow](https://webflow.com/). In my first week, we signed around three subscriptions only, and we were so happy about it. I believed in the team and the mission, and I'm glad I was part of FINN's story. After all of this fantastic time, the story has an end since May 2022 will be my last month at FINN.
